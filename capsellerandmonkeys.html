           <p>The Cap Seller and the Monkeys is a short fable that teaches a lesson about foresight and the consequences of carelessness. The story is about a cap seller who, after a long day of selling his caps, rests under a tree. While he sleeps, a group of mischievous monkeys climbs the tree and takes all of his caps. When the cap seller wakes up and notices that his caps are missing, he is puzzled. The monkeys, however, have put the caps on their heads, imitating the cap seller.

            The cap seller tries to get the caps back by shouting at the monkeys, but they only mimic his actions, laughing and mocking him. Finally, the cap seller realizes that the only way to get his caps back is to trick the monkeys. He throws his own cap on the ground, and the monkeys, seeing this, follow suit and throw all the caps down as well. The cap seller then collects the caps and leaves, teaching the monkeys a lesson in obedience.
            
            The moral of the story is that intelligence and cleverness can solve problems, and it also emphasizes the importance of thinking ahead and not acting rashly in difficult situations.
