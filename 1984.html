         <p> 1984, a dystopian novel by George Orwell, was published in 1949 and is considered one of the most influential works of 20th-century literature. Set in a totalitarian regime called Oceania, the story explores themes of surveillance, propaganda, and oppressive political control. The government, led by the enigmatic figure Big Brother, enforces strict conformity and manipulates truth to maintain power.

            The protagonist, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry of Truth, altering historical records to fit the Party's narrative. As he grows disillusioned, he begins a forbidden relationship with Julia and secretly rebels against the regime. However, he is eventually betrayed, captured, and subjected to brutal psychological and physical torture, ultimately succumbing to the Party's authority.
            
            The novel introduces concepts like Newspeak (a language designed to eliminate dissent) and doublethink (holding contradictory beliefs). Its chilling vision of totalitarianism has made "Big Brother" a symbol of surveillance, and the phrase "Orwellian" is often used to describe authoritarian control. 1984 remains a timeless warning against the dangers of unchecked power and the erosion of truth and individuality.
