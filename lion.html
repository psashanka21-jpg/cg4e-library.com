            <p>C.S. Lewis, born Clive Staples Lewis on November 29, 1898, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was an English writer, scholar, and Christian apologist, best known for his works of fiction, including The Chronicles of Narnia series. He was also a prominent professor of English literature at the University of Oxford and a respected author of non-fiction, particularly in the areas of theology and philosophy.

                Lewis began his education at Oxford University, where he developed an interest in literature, mythology, and ancient languages. He served in World War I before returning to Oxford as a tutor and eventually becoming a Fellow of Magdalen College.
                
                While Lewis is most famous for The Chronicles of Narnia (1950-1956), a seven-book fantasy series for children, he also wrote numerous other works, including The Screwtape Letters (1942), Mere Christianity (1952), and The Problem of Pain (1940). These works explore Christian themes, ethics, and human nature.
                
                In addition to his literary and theological work, Lewis was a close friend of J.R.R. Tolkien, and the two were part of the literary group known as the "Inklings." Lewis's conversion to Christianity and his subsequent writings on faith and reason made him an influential figure in Christian thought.
                
                C.S. Lewis passed away on November 22, 1963, just one week before the death of President John F. Kennedy, but his legacy as a writer of both fantasy and Christian literature endures.</p>
