               <p>Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairy tale about love, kindness, and inner beauty. The story follows Beauty, a kind and intelligent young woman, and a Beast, a prince who was cursed to look monstrous because of his arrogance. When Beauty’s father accidentally trespasses in the Beast’s castle and takes a rose for her, the Beast demands that either the father stays forever or one of his daughters comes in his place. Beauty, out of love for her father, agrees to live in the castle.

                At first, she is frightened by the Beast’s appearance, but over time, she discovers his kindness and generosity. Despite his rough exterior, the Beast treats Beauty with respect, giving her a luxurious life and engaging her in meaningful conversations. As she spends more time with him, she begins to see past his monstrous form and appreciate his true nature. Eventually, she realizes she loves him. When she confesses her love, the curse is broken, and the Beast transforms back into a handsome prince.</p>
