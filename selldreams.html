            <p> Gabriel García Márquez (1927–2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and a key figure in the magical realism literary movement.

                Born in Aracataca, Colombia, García Márquez grew up listening to the folklore and myths of his region, which heavily influenced his writing style. His most famous work, One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), is a multigenerational epic that blends the fantastical with the mundane, set in the fictional town of Macondo. The novel earned him international acclaim and established him as a literary giant.
                
                In addition to One Hundred Years of Solitude, García Márquez wrote other celebrated works, including Love in the Time of Cholera (1985), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981), and The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975). His storytelling often explored themes of love, solitude, and the interplay between myth and reality.
                
                García Márquez received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982 for his contributions to literature. Known affectionately as "Gabo," he spent much of his later life in Mexico City. His works continue to inspire readers and writers worldwide.
