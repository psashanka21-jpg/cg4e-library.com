            <p> J.K. Rowling is a British author, best known for writing the Harry Potter series, which has become one of the best-selling book franchises in history. Born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling attended the University of Exeter and worked in various jobs, including as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International.

                She conceived the idea for Harry Potter during a train journey in 1990 and spent the next several years developing the story. The first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997, followed by six more books in the series, culminating in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007).
                
                Rowling's writing has earned her numerous awards, and she became a billionaire due to the success of her books, movies, and related merchandise. She has also written books under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, including the Cormoran Strike detective series. Apart from her literary success, Rowling is known for her philanthropy and activism.</p>
