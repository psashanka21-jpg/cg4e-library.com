            <p>J.R.R. Tolkien, full name John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, was an English writer, professor, and philologist, best known for creating The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa, Tolkien moved to England with his mother after his father's death. He studied at Oxford University, where he became a professor of Anglo-Saxon and developed a deep interest in languages, mythology, and medieval literature.

                Tolkien is renowned for his creation of the richly detailed fantasy world of Middle-earth, with its intricate languages, histories, and cultures. His works The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings trilogy (1954-1955) have become cornerstones of modern fantasy literature, influencing generations of writers and readers.
                
                In addition to his literary achievements, Tolkien served in World War I and later worked as a professor at Oxford University, where he contributed to the study of Old English and medieval texts. His works have inspired numerous adaptations, including the highly successful film trilogies directed by Peter Jackson.
                
                Tolkien passed away on September 2, 1973, but his legacy as a pioneer of modern fantasy continues to endure.
