<p>The Wizard of Oz is a classic fantasy novel written by L. Frank Baum in 1900. The story follows a young girl named Dorothy Gale, who lives in Kansas with her aunt and uncle. One day, a powerful tornado sweeps her house away, carrying her and her dog Toto to the magical land of Oz. There, she is welcomed by the Munchkins and learns that the only way to return home is to seek help from the Wizard of Oz, who resides in the Emerald City. On her journey, Dorothy befriends a Scarecrow who longs for a brain, a Tin Woodman who desires a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who seeks courage. Together, they face various challenges, including the wicked Witch of the West, who wants to take Dorothy’s magical shoes. When they finally meet the Wizard, they discover that he is just an ordinary man with no real magical powers. However, he helps Dorothy’s friends realize that they already possess what they have been searching for. In the end, Dorothy learns from Glinda, the Good Witch, that she had the power to return home all along by clicking her heels and saying, "There's no place like home." The story conveys important themes such as self-belief, friendship, and the idea that true happiness is found in one’s own home.</p>
