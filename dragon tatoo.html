            <p>Stieg Larsson was a Swedish author, journalist, and editor, best known for writing the Millennium Trilogy, a series of crime novels that gained international acclaim. Born on August 15, 1954, in Skellefteå, Sweden, Larsson grew up with a keen interest in politics, technology, and social justice. He worked as a journalist and editor for Expo, a Swedish magazine focused on anti-fascism and anti-racism, while also researching far-right extremism.

                Larsson's literary career took off with the release of his first novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (originally Män som hatar kvinnor, or Men Who Hate Women in Swedish), in 2005. The book introduced readers to the complex characters of Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled hacker, and Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist investigating corruption. The novel became a global sensation and was followed by The Girl Who Played with Fire (2006) and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (2007).
                
                Unfortunately, Larsson died suddenly of a heart attack in 2004, before he could see the immense success of his books. His Millennium Trilogy was published posthumously and adapted into multiple films and television series in various languages. Larsson's work continues to be celebrated for its intricate plots, strong characters, and social commentary.</p>
