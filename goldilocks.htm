           <p>“Goldilocks and the Three Bears” is a well-known fairy tale that tells the story of a curious girl named Goldilocks. One day, while walking through the forest, she finds a small cottage that belongs to three bears: Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. Out of curiosity, she enters the house. Inside, she tastes their porridge—one is too hot, one is too cold, but Baby Bear’s is just right, so she eats it. Then, she tries their chairs—one too big, one too hard, and Baby Bear’s chair is just right, but it breaks. Finally, she tries their beds—one too hard, one too soft, and Baby Bear’s bed is just right, so she falls asleep. When the bears come home and discover what has happened, Goldilocks wakes up, gets frightened, and quickly runs away. The story teaches children the importance of respecting others’ belongings, honesty, and the consequences of being careless or too curious.</p>
