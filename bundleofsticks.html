          <p>The Bundle of Sticks is a classic fable that teaches the value of unity and cooperation. The story involves a father who has several sons that often quarrel with each other. In an effort to teach them a lesson, the father gives them a bundle of sticks and asks each of them to try and break the bundle. One by one, each son fails to break the bundle, no matter how hard they try. Then, the father unbinds the sticks and gives each son a single stick. They are easily able to break each individual stick. The father then tells them that just as the bundle of sticks was strong when united, they too will be strong if they work together, but if they remain divided, they will be weak and easily defeated.</p>
