                "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" is a fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm. It tells the story of a king who has twelve daughters. Every night, the princesses mysteriously wear out their shoes, but no one knows how or where they go. The king is puzzled and announces that anyone who can uncover the secret will be allowed to marry one of his daughters and inherit the kingdom. However, if they fail after three nights, they will be put to death.

                Many princes attempt the challenge but fail because the princesses secretly drug their drinks, making them fall into a deep sleep. One day, a poor soldier, helped by an old woman, takes up the challenge. She warns him not to drink the wine given by the princesses and gives him an invisibility cloak.
                
                At night, the soldier pretends to drink the wine but stays awake and follows the princesses using the cloak. He discovers that they enter a magical underground kingdom, crossing forests of silver, gold, and diamond trees, and arrive at a beautiful castle where they dance all night with twelve princes. The soldier collects proof, including a golden cup, and reports everything to the king.
                
                As a reward, the soldier chooses the eldest princess as his wife and becomes the future king. The enchanted kingdom disappears, and the dancing spell is broken.</p>
