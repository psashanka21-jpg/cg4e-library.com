         <p> Fortune is a globally recognized American business magazine, first published in 1930 by Henry Luce, co-founder of Time Inc. The magazine is known for its in-depth coverage of business, economics, and innovation, often spotlighting the strategies and stories behind leading companies and industries.

            One of its hallmark features is the Fortune 500, an annual ranking of the top 500 U.S. companies by revenue, which has become a benchmark for business success and influence. Other notable lists include the Global 500, Most Powerful Women, and Best Companies to Work For.
            
            Fortune covers a wide range of topics such as leadership, entrepreneurship, technology, finance, and corporate strategy. Its detailed analysis, investigative journalism, and focus on emerging trends make it a key resource for business leaders, professionals, and anyone interested in the corporate world. Over the years, Fortune has expanded beyond its print origins, embracing digital media and live events to maintain its relevance in the evolving business landscape.
