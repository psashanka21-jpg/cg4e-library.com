<p>“The Frog Prince” is a famous fairy tale that tells the story of a spoiled princess and a magical frog. One day, while playing near a well, the princess loses her golden ball in the water. A frog appears and offers to bring it back, but only if she promises to let him be her friend and stay with her. The princess agrees, but after getting her ball back, she tries to ignore her promise. Later, the frog comes to the castle, and the king reminds his daughter to keep her word. Reluctantly, she lets the frog eat from her plate and stay by her side. In some versions, when the princess angrily throws or kisses the frog, he magically transforms into a handsome prince. The spell is broken, and the prince reveals that he had been enchanted by a witch. Finally, the princess and the prince become friends, and in many versions, they marry. The story teaches lessons about keeping promises, kindness, and looking beyond appearances.</p>        </div>
