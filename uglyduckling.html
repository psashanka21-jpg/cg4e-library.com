          <p>The Ugly Duckling is a famous fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen. The story follows a young bird who is born in a barnyard but looks different from the other ducklings. Because of his unusual appearance, he is mocked, bullied, and rejected by his peers and even his own family. Feeling lonely and unwanted, he leaves in search of a place where he belongs. After facing many hardships and challenges, he finally discovers that he is not a duckling at all but a beautiful swan. The story teaches an important lesson about patience, self-acceptance, and the idea that true beauty lies within. It reminds us that struggles and hardships can lead to growth and transformation, and that everyone has their own time to shine.
