            <p>Oscar Wilde (1854â€“1900) was an Irish writer, poet, and playwright, known for his wit, flamboyant style, and sharp social commentary. He gained fame for works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) and plays like The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Wilde's writing often explored themes 
                of aesthetics, individualism, and the complexities of society. He was known for his clever epigrams and paradoxical statements. His life was marked by scandal when he was convicted of "gross indecency" due to his homosexuality, which led to his imprisonment. Despite his fall from social grace, Wilde remains a significant figure in literary history.</p>
