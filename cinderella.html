           <p>Cinderella is a beloved fairy tale about a kind and gentle young woman who endures hardship and mistreatment but ultimately finds happiness through kindness and perseverance. The story centers on Cinderella, a girl who lives with her wicked stepmother and two cruel stepsisters. They make her do all the household chores, treating her as a servant while they live in luxury.

            One day, the king announces a grand ball where his son, the prince, will choose a bride. Cinderella wishes to go, but her stepmother forbids it and gives her impossible tasks to complete. With the help of her fairy godmother, Cinderella’s dreams come true. The fairy godmother transforms Cinderella’s rags into a beautiful gown and her pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, but warns her that the magic will wear off at midnight. At the ball, Cinderella captivates the prince, but she must leave before midnight, leaving behind a glass slipper.
            
            The prince searches the kingdom for the woman whose foot fits the slipper, and when he arrives at Cinderella’s house, the stepsisters try to deceive him, but the slipper only fits Cinderella. She marries the prince, and they live happily ever after.
            
            The moral of the story is that goodness, patience, and kindness will be rewarded, and it also teaches that inner beauty is far more important than outward appearance.
